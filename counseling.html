			<p> Are you looking for a professional to help you better understand yourself and how to relate more healthily to others and/or to God? Our temperament counseling services can help. We will provide you with a better perspective on your inborn temperament, including its potential weaknesses and strengths, and help you use this knowledge to grow and heal. </p>
			<p> I am licensed through the National Christian Counseling Association for temperament counseling. Be sure to request a counseling session or a temperament evaluation for your career or personal life.</p>
